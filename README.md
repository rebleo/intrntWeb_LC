#### Course Description:
This course covers web programming in the Internet and interactive environment. Students will gain understanding of operating system usage on a server and interactive web system design. Languages used include HTML, CSS, Java Script in addition to overviews of backend systems in Node + Express and PHP, MySQL + AJAX. (Subject to change!!).

---
#### Course Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing positively to discussions, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Although students will need their laptops with them for class, computers should be closed and mobile devices silent + not glowing during lecture, class discussion + critique. You should have no application, web tab or software open that is not relevant to the subject of that day’s class. The mis-use of computational + networked machines will negatively affect your grade. For real.

#### Method of Evaluation:
1. Class Participation (20% of grade): Please arrive on time having completed the assignments. Participation in class discussions and peer feedback are not only expected, but will be reflected in your grade. Attendance to all classes is required and attendance is taken at each class.

2. Design + Technical Exercises (30% of grade): will be executed through the semester by following in class demonstrations, online tutorials and assigned readings. These exercises will be essential for learning markup and coding and to successfully complete more complex projects.

3. Midterm Project (25% of grade)

4. Final Project (25% of grade) 

Course Projects will be evaluated by three components equally: Creativity, Technical Breadth, Professional Presentation. Completed projects should reflect a sense of ambition and dedication toward realization.

#### Attendance:
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of each class. For real.

This class meets for 1 hour and 15 minutes twice per week. Students are expected to come on time, because there is a lot of material to cover. Students who come in later than 20 minutes after the class started will be marked absent. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand and explain why.

 * 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence.
 * 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-).
 * More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
